# Relational Database V8 Certification (freeCodeCamp)

This repository contains my completed projects for the **freeCodeCamp Relational Database V8** certification.  
All work was done using Bash and PostgreSQL.

## Projects
- **Celestial Bodies Database**
- **Student Database**
- **World Cup Database**
- **Salon Appointment Scheduler**
- **Periodic Table Database**
- **Number Guessing Game**
- **Kitty Ipsum Translator**
- **Nano Castle**
- **Bike Rental Shop**

Each folder includes the required Bash/SQL files used to pass freeCodeCamp’s automated tests.

## About
This repo serves as a record of my progress through the certification and a reference for future SQL/Postgres work.
**Note:** Certain projects are missing because of the unbelievable number of bugs I encountered with
the legacy fCC CodeRoad extension, which was required to complete each project. All of them got done. I promise.

## Certification
Successfully completed the Relational Database V8 certification on freeCodeCamp.
